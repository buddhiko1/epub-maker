    <p class="h2subheading">— Show Code View Changes —</p>

    <p>
      Preview is a movable window that gives you a dynamically updated read-only
      view of what appears in Code View. You can also inspect your code and
      styles by clicking the Inspect button (&lt;/&gt; icon) in the toolbar at
      the bottom of Preview.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can use Preview to show the results of changes in your code (including
      immediate feedback of errors), and you can also open a CSS stylesheet to
      make changes that are shown in Preview.
    </p>

    <p>
      Activate the Preview window by selecting the menu item
      <span class="menuitem">View=&gt;Preview</span> or its keyboard shortcut:
    </p>

    <div class="image">
      <img
        alt="Image of main Preview window in action."
        src="../Images/preview-window.png"
      />
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <p class="tiptext">
        You can toggle the Preview window open or closed with its shortcut, and
        even move the window to a second monitor if you have one.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      The Preview window will be updated immediately when you click somewhere in
      Code View. It will also be updated after you stop typing for a short time.
    </p>

    <div class="tip">
      <p class="tiptext">
        If you click in Preview the Code View tab will sync to the same
        location.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="Inspector">Inspector</h3>

    <p>
      The Inspector Widget is opened/closed by clicking the “&lt;/&gt;” button
      on the toolbar
      <img
        src="../Images/preview-window-toolbar.png"
        alt="Preview Window toolbar."
        style="width: 20%"
      />
      at the bottom of Preview. You can resize and reposition it how you like,
      and Sigil will remember your settings
    </p>

    <p>
      <img
        src="../Images/preview-window-inspector.png"
        alt="Preview Window Inspector"
      />
    </p>

    <p>
      The Inspector window is an HTML developer’s tool that allows detailed
      examination of the code behind the book’s appearance. It is intended to
      allow you to see why specific sections of your book are displayed the way
      they are, and to make temporary changes to styles and text to see how they
      affect your text.
    </p>

    <div class="tip">
      <p class="tiptext">
        Any changes you make in the Inspector window are only temporary and are
        not saved!
      </p>
    </div>

      specifically how to use it to determine the exact CSS being used for any
      particular tag, <a href="inspector.xhtml">see this tutorial</a>.
